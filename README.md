# myconfigs
My custom RGMercs - Lua Edition! class configs. Use at your own risk!

To use these: place them in (VV install)\config\rgmercs\class_configs

THESE CONFIGS ARE IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX, TESTING AND UPDATING. THERE WILL BE BROKEN OR HALF-FINISHED ENTRIES.

THESE CONFIGS ARE BASED AROUND A LEVEL 100+ SINGLE-GROUP 6-BOX SETUP ON A LIVE SERVER AND MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR ANYTHING ELSE. NOT TAILORED FOR RAIDING!

THESE CONFIGS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR ALL MODES AND QUITE FREQUENTLY HAVE COMPLETE CUSTOM GEM SETUPS.

THESE CONFIGS ARE NOT FOR THOSE WHO WISH A TRUE PLUG-AND-PLAY EXPERIENCE. YOU MAY NEED TO TWEAK TO YOUR TASTE.


Some spells and abilities are configured by the user in the main RGMercs module and may differ slightly from my own. I will slowly add my default percentages.

ALL OF THIS COMES FROM https://github.com/DerpleMQ2/rgmercs ORIGINALLY.


For those of you who are curious, my current setups I use for playtesting:

Level 120 SK/SHM/BRD/BST/MAG/NEC (Gold, no expansions)

Level ~105 PAL/DRU/BRD/ENC/MAG/WIZ (Gold, no expansions)
