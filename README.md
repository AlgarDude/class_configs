# myconfigs
My custom RGMercs - Lua Edition! class configs. Use at your own risk!

ALL OF THIS COMES FROM https://github.com/DerpleMQ2/rgmercs ORIGINALLY.

I am just a dude who is learning to code a little bit. I like to tweak shit and I like helping other dudes have good shit when I tweak it.
Make no mistake, while I am a regular contributor, none of this is officially endorsed by RGMercs - Lua Edition! developers.

To use these: place them in (VV install)\config\rgmercs\class_configs

*** *PLEASE NOTE* *** As of 23 Sep 2024, all of my custom functions have been fully integrated into the main branch and algar_include.lua is no longer required!


Other updates: 

NEC is now an experimental config in the main branch.

SHM is now in beta for full integration.

ENC is now fully integrated (as the "Modern Era" mode).

SHD is now fully integrated. 

BST is now fully integrated. 

BRD is now fully integrated.


THANK YOU FOR TESTING:
If I've asked you to help me test a specific config, the below warnings likely don't apply! (Dont be skerd yo)

If not:
These configs are in a constant state of flux, edits and testing. There may occasionally be some minor broken functionality, but they will all work overall. I use them every day and I am constantly playtesting my changes.

These configs are based around a single-group 6-box setup on a live server and may not be suitable for TLPs, Raids, etc.

THESE CONFIGS ARE NOT FOR THOSE WHO WISH A TRUE TURN-IT-ON-AND-GO EXPERIENCE. I've tweaked them to my taste, and you may need to do so to yours.

Some of them have custom gem setups, and some of them are very close to their current default counterparts (as they were either a base for editing or I've PRed some of my changes).
If you aren't comfortable editing some gem setups or commenting/uncommenting some entries, consider sticking to the targeted revamp testing.

Some spells and abilities are configured by the user in the main RGMercs module and may differ slightly from my own. Things like heal percentages, etc, may make these play for me and you slightly differently.

For those of you who are curious, my current setups I use for playtesting:

Level 120 SK/SHM/BRD/BST/MAG/NEC (Gold, no expansions)

Level 120 PAL/DRU/BRD/ENC/MAG/WIZ (Gold, no expansions)
