This is simply a copy of my local config directory.

It contains some configs that I have begun adjusting to use on specific emu servers.

These configs are fully functional, but not complete... I am simply editing and adding as I go for the particular classes I play.
These may never be included in the main mercs repo. They may not be up-to-date unless I am actively playing with them.
Use at your own risk! These folders can be dropped into your MQConfigDir/rgmercs/class_configs folder and loaded from the class tab.
Example: C:\Games\MQ\config\rgmercs\class_configs\EQ Might
