This is simply a copy of my local config directory.

It contains some configs that I have begun adjusting to use on specific emu servers; please note it also contains up to date copies of the bundled mercs configs (albeit, at times with some changes I am testing). I will add them to the git ignore at a future date.

These configs are not fully functional, I am simply editing and adding as I go for the particular classes I play.
I have no intention of ever including these in the main mercs repo.
Use at your own risk!
