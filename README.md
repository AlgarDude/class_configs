# myconfigs
My custom RGMercs - Lua Edition! class configs. Use at your own risk!

THESE CONFIGS ARE IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX, TESTING AND UPDATING. THERE WILL BE BROKEN OR HALF-FINISHED ENTRIES.

THESE CONFIGS ARE BASED AROUND A LIVE SERVER IN MIDGAME, LEVEL 100+ AND MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR ANYTHING PRIOR.

THESE CONFIGS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR ALL MODES AND QUITE FREQUENTLY HAVE COMPLETE CUSTOM GEM SETUPS.

THESE CONFIGS ARE NOT FOR THOSE WHO WISH A TRUE PLUG-AND-PLAY EXPERIENCE.

Some spells and abilities are configured by the user in the main RGMercs module and may differ slightly from my own. I will slowly add my default percentages.

ALL OF THIS COMES FROM https://github.com/DerpleMQ2/rgmercs ORIGINALLY.
